    <h1>HOW TO PLAY MANCALA</h1>
        <h3>Mancala is a 2-player game in which players take turns, one by one, to make a move.
        The board has six small pits on each side and a store at left and right end of the board.
        At the beginning of the game 4 candies are placed in each pit.
        The number on top of each pit/store indicates the number of candies in that pit/store.
        You control the six pits on your side of the board.
        Your score is the number of candies in your store.
        The goal of the game is to capture more candies in the store than your opponent. </h3>

            <h3>In your turn, you choose a pit in your control. The chosen pit is emptied. The chosen pit's candies are dropped one by one into subsequent pits and store except for opponent's store, in a counter-clockwise direction, until the candies run out.</h3>
            <h3>An instance has been shown below:</h3>

            <h3>After player 1's turn, it is now Player 2's turn to make a move.
              Remember, in your turn, if the last candy lands in your store,
              you get an Extra Turn!</h3>
          <h3>In another case, let's assume Player 1 chooses to empty the following pit:</h3>
          <img class="display" src="https://ans10.github.io/Mancala/dist/imgs/board16.png">
          <h3>The last dropped candy has landed in an empty pit owned by Player 1, and notice that the pit in the opposite side of the board contains 5 candies.</h3>
          <img class="display" src="https://ans10.github.io/Mancala/dist/imgs/board17.png">
          <h3> The last dropped candy and all the 5 candies in opposite pit are captured and placed in Player 1's store and hence the score increases by 6.</h3>
          <img class="display" src="https://ans10.github.io/Mancala/dist/imgs/board18.png">
            <h3>The game ends when all the six pits on either side of the board are empty.</h3>
            <h3>For instance, let's assume Player 2 chooses to empty the following pit:</h3>
            <img class="display" src="https://ans10.github.io/Mancala/dist/imgs/board22.png">
          <h3>All remaining candies of Player 1 automatically move to Player 1's store and the game ends. Now, Player 1's score is more than Player 2's, Player 1 is the winner.</h3>
